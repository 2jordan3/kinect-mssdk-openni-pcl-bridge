; 0 -- Use "unique ID" for the creation info.
;      This option gives you the unique ID for each device (including the HW
;      serial number) as the creation info. PCL extracts the product ID from 
;      the unique ID to distinguish between K4W and K4Xbox. This mode is enabled
;      by default and must! be used with PCL.
;
; 1 -- Use "connection ID" for the creation info.
;      This option gives you the connection ID for each device (unique within
;      the local computer) as the creation info. The ID depends on the port
;      the device is connected. This mode leads to a mistake when using with PCL,
;      so please don't use this mode with PCL.
